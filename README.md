# WhatsMyDPS
DPS meter mod for TBoI: Repentance. Based very loosely on an [old mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836033374&searchtext=dps+meter), modified and expanded to work with Repentance.

# Installation
Download from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3093468959).

# TODO
- [ ] Make text translucent (and maybe smaller?)
- [ ] Config options
  - [ ] Toggle whether DPS shows in stat sidebar or above isaac
- [ ] Maybe make brimstone and bomb stuff better?
